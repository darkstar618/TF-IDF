TF-IDF Calculator
This Python script calculates the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) score of a user-input word in a given corpus.
Usage
Run the script in your terminal or command prompt.
Enter a word when prompted.
The script will display:
The frequency of the input word in the corpus.
The TF-IDF score of the input word.
Corpus
The script uses a custom corpus, which is a paragraph of text defined in the script. You can modify this corpus to use your own text.
Dependencies
scikit-learn (for TF-IDF calculation)
numpy (for numerical computations)
tabulate (for displaying word frequency in a table)
Functions
get_user_input(): Prompts the user to enter a word.
calculate_tf_idf(): Calculates the TF-IDF score of the input word in the corpus.
print_word_frequency(): Displays the frequency of each word in the corpus in a table.
Note
This script is for demonstration purposes only and can be modified to suit your specific needs.
